    "This is very simple, but it really saved me a lot of time. In fact we can draw a volume from our geometry without having to display the full SHiP geometry. Even if it is sometime required to see how your detector is positioned in the SHiP apparatus, what we often want is just to check our modifications to geometry. We can import the ROOT geometry, getting our detector, and drawing it."
